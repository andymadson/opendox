## Functions

### `__init__()`

```python
__init__(self, config_path: Path)
```

#### Description

This method (`__init__`) initializes an instance of a class with configuration details.

The `__init__` method in Python is a special method that gets called when you create an object of a class using the `class_name(__params__)` syntax. It sets up the attributes for the new object. In this case, it reads and loads configurations from a provided path into the instance's state.

#### Parameters

config_path: str Description of what this parameter does - The file path to the configuration file. This should be in a valid format that Python can open as a file (e.g., '/path/to/config.json').

#### Returns

None, because it doesn't return anything. It only initializes the instance with configurations from the provided path.

Notes:
     This function should be used during object creation to initialize an instance of a class with specific configuration details stored in a file at the specified `config_path`. The actual effect depends on what other methods and properties are defined within the class that uses this method. If there's no such definition, then using this alone won't have any meaningful impact.

### `load_config()`

```python
load_config(self, config_path: Path) -> Dict
```

#### Description

This function loads a configuration file and returns its content as a dictionary.

This function is typically used to load configurations from a specific JSON or YAML format files into Python dictionaries for further use in your code. The configuration data can contain various types of settings, such as paths, URLs, credentials, etc.

#### Parameters

self: It's an instance variable that refers to the current instance of the class and is used within the classâ€™s methods. In this case, it's not required for function 'load_config'.
    config_path: [str] This parameter expects a string representing the path to the configuration file. The file should be in JSON or YAML format.

#### Returns

[Dict] Returns a dictionary containing the content of the configuration file parsed from JSON/YAML into Python dictionaries.

Notes:
    This function raises an exception if it can't open or parse the specified config_path file, so ensure that you have valid paths and files in those locations. Also, keep in mind that this function does not handle error cases where the configuration file is empty or only contains whitespace. Ensure your configurations are properly formatted before calling this function.
