## Functions

### `get_users()`

```python
get_users()
```

**Decorators:**
- `@app.route('/api/users')`

#### Description

This function retrieves a list of users from the system. It does not take any parameters and returns None.

The `get_users` function is designed to fetch all user data currently in the system. Since it doesn't use any specific parameter, it can be used when you need to retrieve all users' information regardless of their status (active or inactive).

Returns:
     None - As this function does not return a value, its return type is described as 'None'.

Notes:
     This function should be used cautiously as it can cause significant load if executed frequently. It's usually more appropriate to use the user details when they are required or needed, such as for displaying a list of users in an application.

### `__init__()`

```python
__init__(self)
```

#### Description

Initializes an instance of a class. This method is automatically called when an object is created from a class, providing a starting point for any initialization code that the class might have.

The `__init__` function in Python represents the constructor of a class. It's called automatically every time an object of the class is instantiated (i.e., when you create an instance of the class). This method can be used to set up initial values for any object attributes that are defined within it, such as instance variables or properties.

#### Parameters

`self` : The first parameter in a Python method/function is always 'self' and refers to the current instance of the class. It does not have a type; you can use whatever name you like instead of 'self'. This convention is followed in all Python code.

#### Returns

No explicit return value as this function should never be expected to return anything, even if it doesn't explicitly state so with `return None`. However, the side-effects of calling a class constructor (i.e., setting up instance variables) can still affect subsequent code execution in the same way that other methods might.

Notes:
     The `__init__` method is usually where you define instance variables and set their initial values. It's called automatically when an object of a class is created, so thereâ€™s no need to call it manually unless you are subclassing and want to override this behavior in your subclass.

### `add_user()`

```python
add_user(self, name: str, email: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

#### Description

Function: add_user

#### Parameters

self (UserManager): An instance of the UserManager class
    name (str): The new user's full name. This parameter should be a string representing the user's full name.
    email (str): The new user's email address. This parameter should be a valid email address as a string.
    
Documentation:
This function is used to add a new user to the system. It takes two parameters - 'name', which is expected to be a string representing the user's full name, and 'email', which is expected to be a valid email address as a string.

#### Returns

A dictionary containing information about the newly added user. This includes fields such as 'id', 'name', 'email', indicating the unique identifier for the new user, their full name, and their email address, respectively. The structure of this dictionary is specific to your implementation of UserManager class and may differ based on its design.

Usage:
Here's an example of how you might use this function in a script that manages users:

manager = UserManager()
new_user = manager.add_user('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')
print(f"New user added with ID: {new_user['id']}")

This example demonstrates how to use the add_user function, where we pass in a name and email as strings to create a new user. The result is then printed out in a format that includes the unique identifier of the newly created user. 

Remember to replace 'UserManager' with your actual class name if it differs from this example.

### `get_all_users()`

```python
get_all_users(self) -> list
```

#### Description

The get_all_users() function retrieves all users from a database and returns them as a list.

This function is typically used in situations where you want to maintain an updated record of all users, such as user management systems or social media platforms. It fetches the necessary data from the 'Users' table present in your database.

#### Parameters

self: Instance of a class that has access to the Users table in the database. This parameter is required for this function to work correctly.

#### Returns

A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains data about one user, including 'user_id', 'username', and 'email'. For example, {'user_id':1234567890,'username':'john_doe','email':'johndoe@example.com'}

Notes:
     This function relies on the database connection provided by the instance of a class that has access to the Users table in the database. If this is not the case, an error will occur when trying to execute this function. Ensure you have necessary privileges and connection before using it.
