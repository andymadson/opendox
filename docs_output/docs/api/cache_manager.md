## Functions

### `__init__()`

```python
__init__(self, redis_url: str)
```

#### Description

Initializes an instance of a Redis client.

The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes, called as a constructor. This method sets up the object with initial values, which are usually provided to the class via parameters. In this case, it's used for setting up an instance of Redis client by taking a URL that points to a Redis server.

#### Parameters

self (instance): A reference to the current instance of the class, automatically passed as the first parameter in Python classes.
    redis_url (str): The URL to connect to a Redis server. This should be in the format `redis://user:password@localhost:6379/0`.

#### Returns

None

Notes:
     This method is typically used at the time of creating an instance of a class, and it sets up any necessary connections to external systems (like Redis in this case). It's important to note that without `__init__`, Python wouldnâ€™t know how to create instances of your classes.

### `get_cached_doc()`

```python
get_cached_doc(self, code_hash: str) -> Optional[str]
```

#### Description

This function retrieves a cached document based on its hash.

The `get_cached_doc` function is used to fetch documents that have been previously stored in the cache with their respective hashes. It utilizes caching mechanisms for improved performance, as it reduces redundancy and boosts efficiency by storing results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

#### Parameters

`code_hash` (str): This parameter is expected to be a string that represents the hash of the document we want to retrieve from the cache. It's used as the key to look up and fetch the desired data in the cache.

#### Returns

Optional[str]: If there exists a cached document with the given `code_hash`, this function will return it as a string wrapped inside an Optional object. If no such document is found, None (NoneType) is returned. This provides flexibility and ease of use by making sure that if no result is found, no exception or error gets thrown.

Notes:
     While using `get_cached_doc` function, it's crucial to ensure the hash parameter provided aligns with what was used while storing/caching the document in memory. This helps avoid pulling incorrect data from cache. Additionally, knowing when and where you would use this function is based on your project requirements about caching documents for performance improvement.

### `cache_doc()`

```python
cache_doc(self, code: str, documentation: str, ttl: int)
```

#### Description

This function caches and stores code, its associated documentation, and a time-to-live (TTL) value. It's designed for storing and retrieving code snippets with their respective documentations and TTL values efficiently.

The function cache_doc is utilized to store pieces of code along with their corresponding documents and TTL(Time To Live). This data can then be retrieved later on using the same key, ensuring that the retrieved information remains relevant for a certain period before it expires. This feature can prove beneficial in improving performance by reducing redundant processing or fetching of the same data repeatedly.

#### Parameters

code: string Description of this parameter is to store the code snippet which needs to be cached and its corresponding documentation.
    documentation: string The purpose of this parameter is to provide a detailed explanation or comments about the code snippet being stored in the cache.
    ttl: integer This parameter defines the time period for which the data will remain valid in the cache before it expires, measured in seconds.

#### Returns

None Description of what this function returns is that after storing a piece of code with its documentation and TTL value, no return value is expected from this function.

Notes:
    The usage of this function requires proper initialization of the cache system before it can be utilized. It should also take into consideration the maximum limit on the number of entries that could be stored in the cache to avoid memory issues.
