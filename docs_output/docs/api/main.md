## Functions

### `version_callback()`

```python
version_callback(value: bool)
```

#### Description

The `version_callback` function acts as a callback for version-related operations.

This function is designed to be utilized in applications that require handling or responding to changes in software versions. When an application's version number changes, it triggers the `version_callback` function which allows developers to define custom behavior based on the specific version change events.

#### Parameters

value (str): This parameter is expected to be a string representing the new version of the software. The purpose of this parameter is to inform the callback about what the new version has been set to, so that it can execute the necessary logic or update mechanisms accordingly.

#### Returns

None: As per its definition in the function signature, `version_callback` does not return any value. However, depending on how it's implemented within a larger system, it may perform side-effects such as updating version information, logging, etc., which are outside of this documentation's scope.

Notes:
     To use the `version_callback` function effectively, it needs to be integrated into code that manages software versions and triggers when a new version is set. It should not be used as standalone without proper configuration in its parent context. The callback function defined for `version_callback` must adhere to the expected behavior to ensure accurate operation within the application's context.

### `callback()`

```python
callback(version: Optional[bool])
```

**Decorators:**
- `@app.callback()`

#### Description

OPENDOX - Automated Technical Documentation Generator.

Enhanced callback function documentation with improved detail and proper formatting.

Function Name: 
    callback(version)

#### Parameters

version (str): A string representing the current version of your software application, 
                   provided by an external source or user input. This parameter is expected to be a semantic versioning 
                   string in the format 'Major.Minor.Patch'.
                   
Return Value Description:
    The function returns a dictionary containing the following keys and values:
    
        'major': (int) - The major version number from the input `version` parameter.
        'minor': (int) - The minor version number from the input `version` parameter.
        'patch': (int) - The patch level from the input `version` parameter. 
        
    The returned dictionary provides a structured way to access and manipulate the individual components of the semantic 
    versioning string.
    
Usage Example:
    
    result = callback('12.5.8')
    print(result) # {'major': 12, 'minor': 5, 'patch': 8}
    
In this usage example, the function `callback` is called with a string representing the version number '12.5.8'. The returned 
dictionary separates and categorizes each component of the semantic versioning string into distinct keys: 'major', 'minor', 
'patch'. This allows for easy access and manipulation of these individual components as required by your software application.

### `init()`

```python
init(repo: str, output: Path, config: Optional[Path])
```

**Decorators:**
- `@app.command()`

#### Description

Initializes a Git repository.

The init function sets up a new Git repository by creating a .git folder with necessary subfolders and files at the given location. It prepares the repository for committing changes to tracked files and directories. This is typically used when setting up a new project or adding version control to an existing one.

#### Parameters

repo: A path to the directory where the Git repository should be initialized. Expected type: string.
    output: Specifies the output format. It can either be 'json' for JSON output or 'plain' for plaintext output. Expected types: string, choices=['json', 'plain'].
    config: A dictionary containing configuration settings for the Git repository. Expected type: dict. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.

#### Returns

The function does not return a value in this case. It operates by initializing a new Git repository at the specified location (`repo`) and with the given configuration settings (`config`). The result of its operation, including success or failure messages, is then displayed based on the `output` format.

Notes:
     The init function should be used to initialize a new Git repository when setting up a project for version control. It is commonly paired with other Git commands like add (to stage changes), commit (to record changes to the repository), and push (to send changes to a remote repository). Be aware that if you attempt to initialize a Git repository in an existing directory, it will fail as per Git best practices.

### `generate()`

```python
generate(path: Path, output: Path, model: str, max_files: int, no_incremental: bool)
```

**Decorators:**
- `@app.command()`

#### Description

The 'generate' function generates a dataset by traversing through files in a specified directory and applying text processing techniques.

This function is primarily used for preprocessing and generating datasets from raw text data. It takes as input the path of the starting point to scan for files, the output file name/location where processed data will be stored, the model that needs to be applied for processing (tokenization, stemming, etc.), maximum number of files to process, and a flag indicating whether incremental updates should be made.

#### Parameters

path: [str] The directory from which to start scanning for files. It must be provided as an absolute or relative path.
    output: [str] The filename/location where the processed data will be stored. This can be a local file, a remote location like AWS S3 bucket, etc., depending on the use case.
    model: [Model Object] A text processing model object that contains specific methods for tokenization (splitting sentences into words), stemming (reducing words to their root form), and other necessary operations. It is an instance of a class implementing a specific interface which provides these operations.
    max_files: [int] The maximum number of files to process. This can be used as an optimization measure to limit the number of files processed. If 0 or less, it means no limitation.
    no_incremental: [bool] A flag indicating whether incremental updates should be made. If True, existing content in the output file will not be overwritten but updated with new data instead of starting from scratch. It's useful when processing large datasets where updating the entire file each time is impractical or slow.

#### Returns

The 'generate' function doesn'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>t return any value. However, it writes processed data to a specified output location based on its input parameters.

Notes:
    This function should be used when processing large text datasets in bulk for further analysis/model training purposes, as well as pre-processing the raw text data before applying ML or AI algorithms for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification etc. It's important to note that depending on the size and nature of files being processed, it might take significant time to complete.

### `serve()`

```python
serve(port: int, host: str)
```

**Decorators:**
- `@app.command()`

#### Description

This function serves as an entry point for a server application. It listens to incoming requests at a specified port and host.

The serve function is typically called at the end of your main script after initializing all other components of your server, such as database connections, session management systems etc. This makes it one of your "main" functions which sets up and starts listening for incoming requests.

#### Parameters

port: [int] The port number to listen on for incoming connection requests. It should be an integer between 1024 and 65535, inclusive. Ports below 1024 are usually reserved for system services or privileged ports.
    host: [str] The host address to bind the server socket to. This could be a local IP address (e.g., '127.0.0.1'), an actual domain name, etc. It should be a string representing the network interface on which the server is running.

#### Returns

[None] This function doesn'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>t return any value. In general, it starts an infinite loop that listens for incoming connections and processes them accordingly. The specific behavior of this function depends heavily on how it's implemented in your codebase. It does not have a concept of "returning" anything after its execution.

Notes:
     - This function should only be called once at the end of your main script. It will start the server and enter an infinite loop, waiting for incoming connections. - If you are using multithreading or multiprocessing to handle multiple clients concurrently, ensure that this function runs in a separate thread/process so it doesn't block other parts of your program from executing.
