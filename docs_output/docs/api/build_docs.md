build_documentation(source_path: Path, output_path: Path)
```

#### Description

This function builds a comprehensive Python function documentation.

The `build_documentation` function takes in two parameters, `source_path` and `output_path`. It reads the docstrings of functions from the source code at `source_path`, parses them to generate markdown-formatted documentation, and writes it to a file located at `output_path`.

#### Parameters

`source_path`: str Description of what this parameter does. It specifies the path to Python script or module from where docstrings will be extracted for documentation generation.
    `output_path`: str Description of what this parameter does. It specifies the path where the generated markdown file will be written.

#### Returns

None The function returns nothing, but it writes a markdown file containing comprehensive documentation to the location specified by `output_path`.

Notes:
    This function is primarily used for generating API documentation from Python scripts or modules. It's important to note that this function expects valid Python code at the source path and follows the standard Python docstring convention for functions.
