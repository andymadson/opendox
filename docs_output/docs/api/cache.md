## Functions

### `__init__()`

```python
__init__(self, project_root: Path, output_dir: Path)
```

#### Description

This method initializes an instance of a class, setting up the basic configuration for that object.

The `__init__` method is automatically called when an object is created from a class using the `classname()` syntax. It sets up essential attributes and configurations required by the class. This includes paths to the project root and output directory, which are used in other methods of the class for file handling operations.

#### Parameters

self: [object] Refers to the instance of the class on which this method is called.
    project_root: [str] The path to the root of the project. It's used to locate files and directories relative to this location.
    output_dir: [str] The directory where generated outputs will be saved. This could be a temporary folder or a permanent storage for future use.

#### Returns

None

Notes:
    This method should not usually be called directly by the user, but is invoked automatically when an object of the class using this method is created. It sets up important paths and configurations that are used throughout other methods in the class. The `project_root` parameter should point to a valid directory on your system, while the `output_dir` parameter can be any path within or outside your project root, as long as it exists and Python has write access to it.

### `_load_cache()`

```python
_load_cache(self) -> Dict
```

#### Description

Loads a dictionary from cache or returns an empty one if not available.

This function is designed to load dictionaries from cache in memory for faster access and retrieval of data, such as user sessions or other application-specific data. If the cache does not exist, it will return an empty dictionary.

#### Parameters

self: It represents an instance of the class that this method belongs to. This is a convention in Python used for methods that belong to objects of a certain class. It allows us to access the attributes and other methods of the object.

#### Returns

Dict: A dictionary loaded from cache if available, else it returns an empty dictionary.

Notes:
    Use this function when you need to load data from cache for faster retrieval or when dealing with application-specific data that doesn'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> need to be persisted across sessions or restarts of the program. This is especially useful in applications where large amounts of data are involved, and caching can significantly speed up data access times.

### `get_file_hash()`

```python
get_file_hash(self, file_path: Path) -> str
```

#### Description

The get_file_hash function computes a hash value for a given file.

This function uses the built-in `hashlib` library in Python to calculate a hash of a specified file. It opens the file, reads it in chunks to avoid loading the entire file into memory (which is problematic if the file is large), and computes the hash value for each chunk before adding them together. This way, even very large files can be handled efficiently.

#### Parameters

`file_path` : str Description of what this parameter does - The path to the file you want to calculate a hash value for. It is expected that the file exists and is accessible by the Python process running this function.

#### Returns

str Description of what is returned - A string representing the hexadecimal representation of the calculated hash value.

Notes:
     This function should be used when you need to verify the integrity or consistency of a file, for instance in data transmission or storage. It's also useful if you want to ensure that two files are identical, although this use case is not typical and could be better served by a simple byte-by-byte comparison.

### `needs_update()`

```python
needs_update(self, file_path: Path) -> bool
```

#### Description

Checks if a file has been modified since last execution or if there is no output.

#### Parameters

self (any): An instance of any class that uses this method. It's usually used as the first parameter in instance methods, and it represents the object on which the method is called.
    
    file_path (str): The path to the file whose existence or modification status we want to check. This should be a string containing the full path of the file including its name and extension. 
                     Example: '/user/documents/myfile.txt'

Return value description: 
    bool : Returns `True` if either the specified file doesn’t exist or has been modified since last execution, otherwise it returns `False`.
    
Usage example(s): 
    Here is an example on how to use this method: 

        instance = MyClass()
        result = instance.needs_update('/path/to/myfile.txt')
        print('File needs update?', result)
        
In the above usage, replace `MyClass` with your class name and ensure that '/path/to/myfile.txt' is replaced with the actual path to file you want to check.

### `update()`

```python
update(self, file_path: Path)
```

#### Description

Performs update operation

 The update() function is used to modify an existing file based on some conditions or needs of the user. It can be used in scenarios where we need to replace, append, or prepend data into an existing file. This can range from updating configuration files, changing content inside HTML/CSS files, etc.

#### Parameters

`file_path`: str Description of what this parameter does is that it expects a string representing the path of the file to be updated. The path could be relative or absolute and must lead to an existing file.

#### Returns

None Description of what is returned here is that after running update(), function doesn't return any value (returns None). It modifies the content of the file in-place.

Notes:
     This function should be used when you need to change or modify an existing file. The path provided must lead to a valid and accessible file otherwise, it will throw FileNotFoundError. Be careful while using this function as it can overwrite any unsaved changes of the file. Always double-check your work before finalizing the update operation.
