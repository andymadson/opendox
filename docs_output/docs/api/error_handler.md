Module containing 3 functions and 1 classes

## Overview

This module contains **3** functions and **1** classes.

### Classes

- [`ErrorCollector`](#errorcollector)

### Functions

- [`__init__()`](#__init__)
- [`add_error()`](#add_error)
- [`report()`](#report)

## Classes

### `ErrorCollector`

```python
class ErrorCollector
```

#### Description

Class ErrorCollector with 3 methods.

#### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `__init__()` | Initialize the class instance |
| `add_error()` | Method implementation |
| `report()` | Method implementation |

## Functions

### `__init__()`

```python
__init__(self)
```

#### Description

Initializes a new instance of the class

 The `__init__` method initializes the attributes of the class. When a new instance of the class is created, this method gets automatically invoked to set up the initial state of the object. This allows us to assign any necessary variables or perform other setup tasks that are required for the object.

#### Parameters

`self`: It's a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belongs to the same object. It does not have to be explicitly passed, Python automatically passes it while calling the constructor method.

#### Returns

The return value for this function is None as indicated by `None` in the docstring. In other words, when we create a new instance of a class and call its `__init__` method, nothing gets returned to the caller.

Notes:
     When defining your own classes, it's often necessary to have an `__init__` method for setting up initial states or attributes of objects created from that class. It's crucial to understand how this special method works in Python classes, as it plays a fundamental role in object-oriented programming.

### `add_error()`

```python
add_error(self, file: str, error: str, line: int)
```

#### Description

Adds error to the collection

 The add_error function works through taking three parameters - an open file object, an error message, and the corresponding line number in that file where the error occurred. The function then appends this information to the file as a new line for future reference or debugging purposes. This enhances readability and understanding of codebase by providing instant insights into potential issues.

#### Parameters

self: [Object] This parameter refers to the instance of the object itself, which allows us to use class methods within this function. It is automatically provided as the first parameter when defining a method in Python classes.
    file: [File Object] An open file where error information will be appended. The file should already exist and be opened for writing ('w' or 'a').
    error: [String] A detailed message describing the type of error that occurred, which provides context for troubleshooting. It is typically a meaningful description of what went wrong in a user-friendly manner.
    line: [Integer] The specific line number within the file where the error originated from. This helps pinpoint and understand where to look when debugging or improving code functionality.

#### Returns

[NoneType] As indicated by the return type, this function does not explicitly return any value (it returns None). However, the side effect of this function is that it modifies the file object passed as a parameter by adding error information to its contents.

Notes:
     When using add_error, ensure to open the file in 'a' mode (append) or 'w' mode (write), depending on your specific needs for error tracking. Failure to do so may result in loss of existing data and corruption of files. It is recommended to use this function during the development phase to track errors early in the process, rather than at the end when many potential issues have been resolved or masked by other code functionality.

### `report()`

```python
report(self)
```

#### Description

This function, named 'report', generates a report based on certain conditions. It does not return any value.

The 'report' function is designed to produce reports based on various conditions that are set in the code itself. These conditions depend on how it is implemented. The goal of this function is to generate comprehensive, useful information about a system or program's state at certain points during its execution.

#### Parameters

self: This parameter represents an instance of the class. In Python, 'self' is used as the first parameter in methods that belong to classes and it binds the method with the object instances.

#### Returns

None - The function does not return any value. It generates reports based on conditions but doesn't produce a result for use elsewhere.

Notes:
     The 'report' function is designed to be called at certain points in your program, often within methods that are triggered by events or conditions you set. This allows you to generate specific information about the state of your system based on when and where itâ€™s needed for debugging, logging, monitoring, etc. It should be used with caution as its behavior can depend heavily on how it's implemented in your code. Incorrect usage could lead to incorrect data being reported or even causing issues if not designed correctly.
