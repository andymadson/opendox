### __init__(self, model)

"Initializes an instance with a given model for our AI-based chatbot's response prediction." \n\nArgs:\n   - self (required) : Instance of object.\n    This ensures that the method can always access its owner.  \n     In Python, this is not required but some programming languages may require it like using 'self'. It serves as a reference to the current instance's values and methods\n- model: A preloaded ML Model for predicting chatbot responses in response_predict()."

### generate(self, prompt, max_tokens)

Function for generating text based on prompt and max tokens.

### generate_function_doc(self, function_data)

"This Python method generates a new python code block from given 'function data' by replacing all placeholders with actual values."

### enhance_docstring(self, function_data, existing)

**Enhances a Python method's or class attribute by adding useful information to its documentation string that might not otherwise be possible with simple commenting alone in python source code files directly (e.g., "Args:" section). The purpose of this is so as the function call `help(function_name)` can display it when needed, instead a developer has only one line explaining what's going on for no additional context about how and why to use that method or class attribute**

### generate_new_docstring(self, function_data)

Function generates a new Python code snippet based on provided input data.
