# error_handler

### __init__(self)

### add_error(self, file, error, line)

Adds an error to a file object and returns True if successful; otherwise False.

Args:
- self (FileObject instance) : Instance associated with this method call via callback. It is automatically passed in by the calling code but can be useful for debugging or other purposes too, unlike arguments given directly within function calls which are not accessible from outside these kind of methods/callbacks and so cannot use them as abovementioned 'self'.
- file (FileObject instance) : The File object to add error into.  This could also represent the specific resource being used in a non local variable inside some method or block, like an email client connection that must be closed after each operation but isn't defined within here and so cannot use it as abovementioned 'file'.
- error (str) : A string representation of what went wrong. This could also represent the specific resource being used in a non local variable inside some method or block, like an email client

### report(self)

The report method in Python is a way to generate textual descriptions for classes or functions using either string formatting (`format()`) methods and/or f-strings which provide more readable code. Here's the requested docstring content without defining any function definition nor triples quotes as per your request:
