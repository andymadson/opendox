## Functions

### `get_users()`

*Defined at line 33*

```python
get_users()
```

## Brief Description 
This Python method retrieves users information from a database using SQL queries and returns them as list in dictionary format with user ids being keys for easy accessibility during data processing later on or printing to console if no such functionality is required.  

Args section includes the following parameters which represent input of this function:  none - since it does not take any external inputs but reads from a database and returns output as list in dictionary format with user ids being keys for easy accessibility during data processing later on or printing to console if no such functionality is required.  
## Returns section will describe the return value which could be either None (if there're none) Or can contain different types of outputs depending upon what this function actually does like list, dict etc based on requirements provided in docstring and example usage for each case mentioned below  otherwise it would not appear because we are only providing information from context.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example usage of get_users
result = get_users()
```

### `__init__()`

*Defined at line 11*

```python
__init__(self)
```

The Google style is to include a brief summary in one line, followed by an Args section with each argument's name and description inside parentheses (also known as optional arguments), then follows Returns after which it lists out what kind of output will be. If the function does not have any input parameters or outputs other than return values from calling functions/methods used in this context, no example content should follow Args section only for its purpose to denote that part is non-existent without an actual argument being passed into a method call made inside it which would violate Google's docstring style guide.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example usage of __init__
result = __init__(self)
```

### `add_user()`

*Defined at line 14*

```python
add_user(self, name, email)
```

The function 'add_user' already has all required parts (Arguments and Return values). Therefore nothing more to be added in docstring for this part of code as it is complete now with its requirements specified.  Here are some additional details if you want them included, but they would not increase the functionality or make sense:
- **Raises** - This section should indicate any exceptions that might occur while executing and can't be covered by a `Returns` clause (e.g., database errors). For example "DatabaseError".  However since this function doesnâ€™t raise exception for sure, so it could just use 'None'.
- **Examples** - This section should include examples of how the method is used in different

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example usage of add_user
result = add_user(self, name, email)
```

---

### `get_all_users()`

*Defined at line 28*

```python
get_all_users(self)
```



**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example usage of get_all_users
result = get_all_users(self)
```
